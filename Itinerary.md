 - types vs. values
 - data types (bool, int, float / double, enum, char, string)
 - array (only use in library code)
 - keywords / operator (everything that is not a keyword is built somewhere in a library using C++)
 - in the beginning god created main (hah! not a keyword, but special)

 - member function
 - string is different (string is a class with many overloaded operators)
 - hello world

Homework:
 - BMI calculator
 
 # Part 2
 - implicit conversions
 - namespaces 
 - ADL (argument dependant lookup)
 - function overload resolution
 - declairation / deffinition 
 - organization / headder / headder only
 - inline
 - translation unit

 - optimizer
 - code example: BuggyName class

Homework:
 - find as many bugs in BuggyName as you can
